# seng1120_A2 - Grade Received: 100% + Bonus Marks for templating classes.

SENG1120 is a Data Structures course run by the University of Newcastle. 

Assignment Scope:   
                    Build a new version of the traditional board game Connect Four. 
                    The board will be implemented as an array of seven stacks.
                    Each stack should be implemented using Node, LinkedList and LStack classes.
                    You will need to implement the logic of the game inside the class GameplayStack: 
                    how to add pieces, checking for the winner or tie after each piece is added to the board, 
                    and displaying either the message "X Wins", "O Wins", or "Game Tie". 
                    You will also need to display the board at the end.
                    
                    Bonus Marks: If implemented using class templates. 

Requirements:       
                    Your code must work seemlesly with the files supplied.

Restrictions:       
                    Must use C++ 98 and manually manage memory allocation. 
                    Must use Cygwin compiler to run the program. 
                    
Marking Criteria:   
                    If the program compiles you receive full marks (10) less deductions as follows;
                      • Code leads to memory leaks during execution (____/-1.0)
                      • Lack of macroguards (____/-1.0)
                      • Lack of destructors (____/-1.0)
                      • Lack of const qualifiers (____/-1.0)
                      • Lack of comments/documentation in the code (____/-2.0)
                      • Direct acceess to LInkedList to facilitate printing ot analysis (___/-5.0)
                      • Declaration of temporary variables as member variables of the class (____/-1.0)
                      • Lack of use of dynamic memory allocation in Node or LinkedList (____/-10.0)
                      • Use of friend qualifier (____/-2.0)
                      • Violation of encapsulation / information hiding (e.g. use of global variables) (____/-5.0)
                      • Implementation in the header file (____/-2.0)
                      • Correctness of Submission, filenames and format (___/-5.0)
